Customer-Segmentation-using-Clustering-Algorithms

Project Overview:

→ Customer Segmentation using Clustering Algorithms is a machine learning project that groups customers based on similar characteristics like age, income, and spending behavior. It uses clustering techniques such as K-Means to identify patterns in customer data. This helps businesses understand customer types and create better marketing strategies.

→ Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing customers into different groups based on similarities like age, income, and spending behavior. This project uses clustering algorithms to group customers for better business understanding.

Objective:

→ The main objective of this project is to segment customers into different clusters using machine learning techniques.

Technologies Used:

→  Python

→  Pandas

→  NumPy

→  Matplotlib

→  Scikit-learn

→  Streamlit

Algorithm Used:

→  K-Means Clustering

How to Run the Project:

1. Install required libraries:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn streamlit
   

2. Run the Streamlit app:
 streamlit run app.py

streamlit link : https://customer-segmentation-using-clustering-algorithms-akshi28.streamlit.app/

Github link : https://github.com/akshi281/Customer-Segmentation-using-Clustering-Algorithms

Project Structure:

→  app.py - Main Streamlit application

→  dataset.csv - Customer dataset

→  README.md - Project documentation

Output:
The model groups customers into different clusters and visualizes them using graphs.
